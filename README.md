# Zacharewski Lab Expression DataViewer (ZED) ShinyApp
Version 4.0

Initiatives that promote Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles 
are becoming a key criteria of public research funding agencies. FAIR principles enable new knowledge 
to be derived from existing data with minimal additional investment in data generation. The Michigan 
State University (MSU) Superfund Research Center (SRC) has produced vast amounts of data characterizing 
the mechanisms and impact of exposure to aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands. To promote their 
FAIRness, we have developed FAIRTox, an open-source web-based data exploration, visualization, and 
analysis application for toxicogenomic datasets. FAIRTox is built using a R Shiny framework, chosen 
due to its wide use as a tool for omics data analysis, and the availability of other R packages for 
enrichment and multidimensional analyses such as principal component analysis (PCA). Unprocessed 
and analyzed datasets are stored in a SQL relational database enabling querying through a user-friendly 
interface. Metadata filters allow users to visualize and compare gene expression responses to various 
experimental factors such as zeitgeber time, dose, and duration of exposure to various environmental 
contaminants. Enrichment and advanced analysis features also facilitate the integration of datasets 
furthering the development of novel hypotheses. In addition, the implementation of FAIRTox makes publicly 
available MSU SRC toxicogenomic data more accessible to researchers without transcriptomic expertise. 
FAIRTox is implemented as a Docker container ensuring portability and reproducibility for groups looking 
to execute their own local version. Ultimately, the goal of FAIRTox is to improve data sharing, reuse, 
and reproducibility through an intuitive interface that serves bioinformaticians and novices alike.

## Running Locally
3a. Install correct R version and required packages (listed above)

4a. Open in RStudio and run

## Deployment in Docker
3b. Install Docker from link below
Docker - [Version 18.09.3 build 77a1f4eee](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (later versions not tested)

This section is performed within the Docker command line.
4b. Before starting, make sure you have the most recent version and are operating on the deployed node for the current version.
```
$ git pull https://gitlab.msu.edu/naultran/zed.git
$ git checkout FAIRTox_V4.0_live
```

5b. Run bash script
```
./docker_container_rebuild.sh
```

6b. To ensure container is running
```
$ docker ps
```

7b. To access the ShinyApp, navigate to dockerhost:80 in your web browser of choice.

## Deployment on AWS
1. Download and install PuTTY
2. Start empty EC2 instance on AWS (we recommend t3.xlarge). Detailed instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html) 
3. Follow steps [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html) for connecting to new instance
4. Launch app within docker container (above)
